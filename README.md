### Next Steps
1. **Add metadata preservation**
     - What: Keep track of section headers, page numbers, and document structure
     - Why: Context is crucial for medical content (e.g., knowing if a statement is from "Contraindications" vs "Recommendations")
     - Impact: Enables more accurate comparison between article claims and guideline sections

2. **Implement section header preservation**
     - What: Keep track of which guideline section each chunk belongs to
     - Why: Medical guidelines are hierarchically structured (e.g., "4.2 Treatment in Pregnancy")
     - Impact: Enables context-aware searching and better result interpretation

3.  **Add intelligent chunk boundaries**
     - What: Split text at meaningful points (e.g., section breaks) rather than arbitrary character counts
     - Why: Medical concepts often need to stay together for proper understanding
     - Impact: Better preservation of medical context and relationships




### Phase 2: Analysis Components

1. **Query Formation Module**
   - Input: 
     * Current sentence
     * Context object containing:
       ```python
       {
           "heading": "Main section heading",
           "subheading": "Subsection heading (if any)",
           "paragraph": "Full paragraph text"
       }
       ```
   
   - Process:
     * Determine if sentence contains verifiable medical claim
     * If yes:
       - Format as "verify: [statement]"
       - Use context for reformulation if needed
     * If no:
       - Skip sentence with explanation
   
   - Output:
     * Structured response:
       ```python
       {
           "needs_verification": bool,
           "query": "verify: [statement]" or None,
           "reasoning": "Explanation of decision"
       }
       ```
   
   - Integration:
     * Implemented as standalone LLM agent
     * Uses simple prompt-based approach
     * No need for retrieval infrastructure at this stage
   
   - Test:
     * Verify correct identification of medical claims
     * Check appropriate use of context in reformulation
     * Validate query formatting consistency

2. **Verification Engine** (replaces previous Comparison Engine)
   - Input: Verification queries and retrieval results
   - Process:
     * Execute semantic search using existing retrieval_graph
     * Analyze guideline evidence against claim
     * Generate structured verification response:
       ```
       {
           "claim": "original statement",
           "verification_status": "CONFIRMED|CONTRADICTED|PARTIALLY_VALID|UNCLEAR",
           "evidence": "relevant guideline text",
           "reasoning": "explanation of verification decision"
       }
       ```
   - Integration:
     * Uses existing retrieval_graph for semantic search
     * Extends current configuration system for verification settings
     * Leverages existing vector store and embedding setup
   - Test: Verify accurate verification decisions and evidence matching



### Phase 3: Validation Layer

   - Test: Verify reduction in false positives

8. **Evidence Collector**

### Phase 4: State Management
9. **LangGraph State Implementation**
   - Define state schema
   - Implement state transitions
   - Test: Verify proper state flow and persistence

10. **Workflow Controller**
    - Build main graph structure
    - Implement cycle management
    - Test: Verify proper flow through all components

### Phase 5: User Interface
11. **Results Formatter**
    - Structure output format
    - Implement evidence highlighting
    - Test: Verify clear, actionable output

12. **Progress Tracking**
    - Implement progress indicators
    - Add status reporting
    - Test: Verify accurate progress reporting

### Phase 6: Deployment
13. **Cloud Integration**
    - Setup cloud infrastructure
    - Implement security measures
    - Test: Verify scalability and reliability

14. **User Interface Integration**
    - Build web interface
    - Implement user controls
    - Test: Verify user experience and functionality

### Development Approach:
- Each component should be built as a standalone module
- Each module should have its own test suite
- Components can be tested with simplified inputs before integration
- Use mock data for initial development
- Implement logging and monitoring from the start

Would you like to start with any particular phase or component? We can begin building and testing individual pieces while keeping the larger architecture in mind.
