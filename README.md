# Guidelines Analysis Project

## Project Overview

### Phase 1: Document Processing Foundation âœ“ (Partially Complete)

#### 1. Document Loader Module (80% Complete)
- âœ“ Implemented PDF guideline loader using PyPDFLoader
- âœ“ Added chunking with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- âœ“ Organized in modular structure under `src/shared/document_loader.py`
- ðŸ”„ Still Needed:
  - Metadata preservation during loading
  - Error handling for malformed PDFs

#### 2. Chunking Strategy Module (70% Complete)
- âœ“ Implemented basic chunking with configurable size and overlap
- âœ“ Added configuration management for chunk parameters
- ðŸ”„ Still Needed:
  - Section header preservation
  - Intelligent chunk boundaries based on content
  - Context preservation between chunks

#### 3. Vector Store Setup (90% Complete)
- âœ“ Implemented Chroma vector store integration
- âœ“ Added OpenAI embeddings setup
- âœ“ Created persistent storage management
- âœ“ Implemented efficient retrieval mechanism
- ðŸ”„ Still Needed:
  - Metadata filtering options

### Next Steps
1. **Add metadata preservation**
     - What: Keep track of section headers, page numbers, and document structure
     - Why: Context is crucial for medical content (e.g., knowing if a statement is from "Contraindications" vs "Recommendations")
     - Impact: Enables more accurate comparison between article claims and guideline sections

2. **Implement section header preservation**
     - What: Keep track of which guideline section each chunk belongs to
     - Why: Medical guidelines are hierarchically structured (e.g., "4.2 Treatment in Pregnancy")
     - Impact: Enables context-aware searching and better result interpretation

3.  **Add intelligent chunk boundaries**
     - What: Split text at meaningful points (e.g., section breaks) rather than arbitrary character counts
     - Why: Medical concepts often need to stay together for proper understanding
     - Impact: Better preservation of medical context and relationships

### Development Approach:
- Each component should be built as a standalone module
- Each module should have its own test suite
- Components can be tested with simplified inputs before integration
- Use mock data for initial development
- Implement logging and monitoring from the start

Would you like to start with any particular phase or component? We can begin building and testing individual pieces while keeping the larger architecture in mind.
